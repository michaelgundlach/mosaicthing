gae loads lead, others, makes thumbs.
sends lead to sorryrobot, gets back array of colors.
sends each (tinyfied if needed) thumb to sorryrobot, gets back color.

chooses best thumb itself.  asks for tinting of thumb by tuple values.

img.sr.com/tint => image data
  r=-4&g=50&b=-30&img=xyzxyzxyz...

img.sr.com/getavgcolor => (4, 5, 6)
  img=xyzxyzxyz...

if there is one that is close enough, don't send to sr, to save bw.

cache tile under (jobid, target color) in case we need that slot again
or another slot is same color.  (or cache rounded to nearest 10 each
so we have better chance of not asking sr for something almost identical?)

the computer:
1. loads lead and others
2. converts others to thumbs
3. gets colors for leads and thumbs
4. sends thumbs and lead to user
5. tints tiles
6. sends tiles to user

if we do this on GAE, 3 and 5 happen on SR, and we have also:
7. sends tiles to SR for tinting
8. sends leads and tiny thumbs to SR for coloring
9. gets tiles from SR tinted

so, if we do this on GAE, only the conversion to thumbs happens on GAE.
we could calculate colors on GAE natively with BMPs: slow, but could do
during the Prepare stage for each thumb.

on GAE, assuming GAE doesn't do color avgs, per mosaic SR will:
 - read lead, read tiny thumbs
 - read many full size thumbs
 - write tiles

if we did this on SR completely, per mosaic SR will:
 - read lead, read thumbs
 - write thumbs, write tiles

bandwidth use is maybe 5% or 10% less overall (write thumbs = only diff.)

now, computation.  if on GAE, per mosaic SR will:
 - color each lead and thumb
 - tint each tile

if all on SR, per mosaic SR will:
 - color each lead and thumb
 - tint each tile

same computation on SR!  argh.

use tinted divs instead of actually tinting!  except IE will take fudging
with to make it work.  of course.

i can really tinify the lead and thumbs to get colorization from SR.  then i
can do tinting with DIVs, and SR only has to colorize about one large image's
worth.  

# will get avg color of whole image!
color = img.resize( (1,1), Image.ANTIALIAS).getpixel((0,0))

# could i convert to 1x1 using gae, then to BMP, then just read it?
# no.  only to PNG, and only 3x3 smallest.
but SR can do 1000 3x3 colorizations in .22 seconds (in a loop, 1 request).
so all thumbnails together could be done in no time.
