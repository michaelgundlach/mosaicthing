150 feed images
tiles must be like 30x30 to get any detail = 900 tiles

300 in + 400 in + 300 out + 1800 in + 20 misc + 400 out + 300 out + 1800 out + 1000 out
2500 in + 3800 out + 20 misc

call it 2.5M in, 4M out per mosaic.

bw is 10 cents per gig in, 12 cents per gig out.

that's .01 cents per meg in, .012 cents per meg out.

2.5 M in * .01 cents per meg in = .025 cents per mosaic for incoming
4 M out * .012 cents per meg out = .048 cents per mosaic for outgoing

.025 + .048 = .073 cents per mosaic total.

1370 mosaics = $1.

we could squeeze that to 1500 mosaics surely by limiting feed size (150
doesn't have to be average, it could be max) or out resolution.

assuming avg ad costs 10 cents, i need ten ad clicks per 1370 mosaics.  assume
2 mosaics per user: 1370 mosaics is 685 users.  i need ten ad clicks in 685
users, or 1 in 68.  that's 1.5% clickthrough rate.  doubtful on a website like
this.

if i got 1% clickthrough, i'd get 2/3 the income i need, and thus i could do
three times as many mosaics for a dollar: 4000.  at 2 mosaics per user, that's
2000 users per dollar.  i'd pay 10 dollars a month to have 20,000 people use
my site(?)

BUT! i get free quota as well.  10G in and 10G out free.  
2.5M in, 4M out per mosaic. that's 2500 out free, 4000 in free.  certainly
1250 users free per day, * 30 = 37500 users free per month.

or, at 10 cents per gig in and 12 cents per gig out, that's a free $2.20 per
day, or $66/mo.  that could support 66 * 2000 = 130,000 users per month, free.
SWEET.  assuming perfectly normal distribution.
