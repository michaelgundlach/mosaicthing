Note from 2017: this is an old project from ~2008? that I exported from Google App Engine to save for posterity.  GAE no longer supports this Python version.  Below are old notes to myself.

= MosaicThing =


== TODO ==

limit thumbs to use before tiling

tile weighting so we don't have a million of the same tile for "Orange"

clean up the code

see todos in code

money math

make entire tiling take a max of X seconds -- so that really big ones don't take so long.  if possible.

how to handle really big mosaics?  for now just don't allow images bigger than available screen real estate, but... maybe really big ones just get saved as a bunch of images to print?  or sent straight to printer?




== feature requests ==

clean out jobs that are old

picasa feed discovery instead of HAVING to give the RSS link

flickr et al

sliders

save

"mosaics you've made" (what do they look like small?)

email to a friend

download

print

digg etc buttons

adsense (where on the page?)

handle giant feeds gracefully (smaller icons, limit max maybe)



== crazy ideas ==

print giant mosaics -- for a fee -- and i turn around and send them to Kodak

print giant mosaic-by-numbers for real tile mosaics




== optimizations i could do if needed ==

we cache thumbnails at size=50, and then rebuild them for smaller.  instead we could cache thumbnail at size=[largest useful], as "main_thumb", then reiize that instead of resizing and cropping the original feed_url.
